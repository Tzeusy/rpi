# Arduino
Example codes for interfacing with an Arduino using the Raspberry Pi.

## arduino_serial
Connecting the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi via USB, then communication through the Serial library in Arduino, and in Python.

## nanpy_fade
Using the [Nanpy](https://github.com/nanpy/nanpy) library, to control the Arduino directly through Python in the Raspberry Pi. In this method, the Arduino is simply a slave that carries out the functions described on Python and executed through the Raspberry Pi.
